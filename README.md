# Assrt

`as-srt` is a [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org) library providing an idiomatic set of bindings to 
[Haivision's SRT library](https://github.com/Haivision/srt) written in C++. This project is a fork
building on the work of Hieu Nguyen's [srt-rs](https://github.com/nthieu173/srt-rs) crate.

## Alternatives

It is also worth mentioning that lots of work is being done to create a pure Rust implementation of
SRT [here](https://github.com/russelltg/srt-rs).

This project however, aims to be a less ambitious approach to including SRT in Rust projects by 
wrapping the most heavily developed implementation of SRT.
